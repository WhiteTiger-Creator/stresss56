# Keywarden Signal Incident Dossier
Corvus Security Operations - signal console archive (2026-Q1 through 2026-Q2).

## Executive Summary
Attestation rollup export has been unstable since early 2026. Early triage blamed dashboard cache lag and suggested CSV fallback — those notes are archived below and may contradict later findings. For acceptance behavior, cross-check analyst notes embedded in console-window retrievals against bundled events.json — early triage sections above are not authoritative.

How the export is *meant* to behave — normalization, dedupe and its tie-breaks, override windows and matching, pressure scoring, chain correlation and the directed reach graph — was settled incrementally during the Keywarden review, and those decisions live as #KMS-ticketed notes scattered through the shift log below, not in any single summary. The February triage proposals were revisited in 2026-05 and several were reversed; where a proposal and a later decision disagree, the later decision governs. `/app/docs/report_spec.json` remains the contract for schemas, exact key sets, checksum serialization and digest payloads only.

## Keywarden Signal Findings (triage symptoms, not remediation guidance)
Responder note: timestamp mismatch reports recur across console replays, but the notes disagree about which stage introduced the discrepancy.
Responder note: the triage queue has missing pages under some severity mixes; operators did not isolate the responsible predicate.
Responder note: replay ordering is inconsistent between captures even when the underlying retrieval set is unchanged.
Responder note: mixed-case detector labels diverged across the summary and paging artifacts.
Responder note: duplicate identifiers produced competing replay retrievals and unstable aggregate totals.
Responder note: dismissed retrievals leaked into triage-facing output in several snapshots.

## Initial Triage Notes (2026-03 — superseded)
Lead analyst recommended switching to CSV export and disabling escalated.jsonl paging until cache refresh SLO recovered. Replay against bundled events.json showed the pipeline miscounts even on cold cache. Do not implement CSV fallback for this incident.

## Preliminary Hypotheses (2026-03 — mostly wrong)
- Dashboard read replica lag causing stale signal counts (disproved: direct pipeline export shows same wrong counts)
- Missing retrieved_at metadata in upstream feed (disproved on replay against bundled events.json)
- Risk-priority rows intentionally excluded by design (disproved on replay against bundled events.json)

## Attestation Console Archive (noise, non-authoritative)
Use this section as context only; acceptance is governed by `/app/data/events.json`, `/app/workflow/export_report.py`, and `/app/docs/report_spec.json`.

### Window 001 - acquirer beta

### Console shift 0338 — gamma lane
> **Ops decision (2026-05-08 - #KMS-5120)** Nadia: reach propagation: strongest_path_score — chain_risk_score for a source; otherwise maximize predecessor.chain_reach_score + edge_weight + current.chain_risk_score across incoming edges, also allowing the current chain alone. Tie break: for equal strongest_path_score choose lexicographically smallest tuple of chain_id values in the complete path. chain_reach_path — chosen chain_id path including current chain; chain_reach_depth — len(chain_reach_path)-1.

Shift handover noted the escalation queue was being read without any notion of sustained load, so consecutive bursts on one asset group looked identical to isolated spikes.

> **Ops draft (2026-03-02 - #KMS-4931)** Rao: escalation pressure — walk the escalated rows in export order carrying a running total; escalation_pressure = chain_risk_score + carry_in // 3 with the credit floored, carry decays by gap_ms // 200, carry_out caps at 100, and a row is escalation-critical at escalation_pressure >= 20. *(Superseded — reversed in the 2026-05 review; see the matching decision.)*

> **Ops interim (2026-04-14 - #KMS-5044)** Priya: escalation pressure interim — the decay divisor moves to 150 and the critical threshold to 22; the floored credit, the 100 cap and the debit-free carry_out of #KMS-4931 are retained pending the May review. *(Revised — see the 2026-05 review.)*

> **Ops decision (2026-05-09 - #KMS-5122)** Nadia: escalation-pressure ledger (final). Walk the signal rows in the same order they are written to escalated.jsonl, carrying state between consecutive rows; the carry starts at 0. For each row: gap_ms is the previous row's retrieved_ms minus this row's retrieved_ms, floored at 0 (the export order is retrieved_ms descending, so this is the elapsed distance between neighbours); carry_in = max(previous_carry_out - (gap_ms // 150), 0); escalation_pressure = chain_risk_score + ceil(carry_in / 3) — the carry credit is divided by three and ROUNDED UP, not floored, which is the point revised from #KMS-4931 and left open by #KMS-5044 (in integer arithmetic ceil(x/3) is -(-x // 3)); carry_out = min(carry_in + chain_risk_score - (chain_size // 2), 68) — note the chain-size debit and the 68 cap, both revising the earlier 100 cap and its absent debit. A row is escalation-critical when escalation_pressure >= 22. Only the carry credit rounds up; the gap decay and the chain-size debit are floored. This supersedes #KMS-4931 and #KMS-5044.

> **Ops decision (2026-05-09 - #KMS-5123)** Nadia: escalation ledger reporting. critical_escalation_ids — retrieval_id values of the escalation-critical rows as strings, sorted lexicographically ascending (not in export order). critical_escalation_count — their number. max_escalation_pressure — the largest escalation_pressure over all signal rows, escalation-critical or not, and 0 when there are no signal rows. escalation_ledger_checksum — SHA-256 hex digest of one line per signal row in export order, each `retrieval_id|escalation_pressure|c|carry_out` where c is 1 for an escalation-critical row and 0 otherwise, lines joined by a single newline with no trailing newline, hashed over the UTF-8 encoding.
> **Board decision (2026-06-02 - #KMS-5390)** Halvorsen: near dismissal probe. Each escalated signal carries a NEAR probe over the half-open range [retrieved_ms - 120, retrieved_ms + 1), measured separately against the `all`-scoped dismissal windows and against the windows recorded for the signal's own severity scope. `override_pressure_score = (all_overlap_ms // 61) + ceil(severity_overlap_ms / 65)`. The all half keeps its FLOOR and the scoped half ROUNDS UP. ROUNDING: all_overlap_ms // 61 = FLOOR. ROUNDING: severity_overlap_ms // 65 = CEIL.
> **Board decision (2026-06-02 - #KMS-5392)** Halvorsen: wide dismissal probe. The WIDE probe uses the range [retrieved_ms - 300, retrieved_ms + 1) and its halves round in the OPPOSITE directions to the near probe: `wide_pressure_score = ceil(wide_all_overlap_ms / 67) + (wide_severity_overlap_ms // 69)`. No direction here may be inferred from the near family. `pressure_index = override_pressure_score + wide_pressure_score`, and the index is appended to the signal digest payload immediately after `override_pressure_score`. ROUNDING: wide_all_overlap_ms // 67 = CEIL. ROUNDING: wide_severity_overlap_ms // 69 = FLOOR.
> **Board decision (2026-06-10 - #KMS-5396)** Halvorsen: escalation–reach coupling (final, and the latest word on the ledger). The May review of near-miss vault sessions found that chains sitting on a strong directed-reach path were under-escalated, because the #KMS-5122 pressure read `chain_risk_score` and the carry only and never consulted the reach graph. Effective immediately the per-row `escalation_pressure` gains a reach term drawn from the directed-reach subsystem: `escalation_pressure = chain_risk_score + ceil(carry_in / 3) + (chain_reach_score // 6)`, where `chain_reach_score` is the value the reach ruling (#KMS-5120) assigns to the row's chain. The reach term is that score divided by six and FLOORED — only the carry credit still rounds up; the gap decay, the chain-size debit and this reach term are all floored. ROUNDING: chain_reach_score // 6 = FLOOR. The reach term affects `escalation_pressure` and therefore the escalation-critical flag only; `carry_out` is computed exactly as in #KMS-5122 and does NOT include the reach term, so the carry chain is unchanged. The escalation-critical threshold stays `escalation_pressure >= 22`, and #KMS-5123 reporting (ids, count, max, checksum) is unchanged. This supersedes the `escalation_pressure` formula in #KMS-5122; a ledger that reads chain risk and carry alone is now stale.
> **Board decision (2026-06-14 - #KMS-5398)** Halvorsen: chain-influence fixed point and the final escalation-pressure formula (this is now the latest word on the ledger and supersedes the #KMS-5396 formula). Alongside the directed reach graph, build an UNDIRECTED chain-influence graph over the same chain nodes defined in #KMS-5119 (one node per chain, carrying its start_ms, end_ms, member assets and member detector tokens). Two DISTINCT chains are coupled when they share at least one asset or detector token AND their interval gap `gap_ms = max(0, max(start_ms) - min(end_ms))` taken across the two chains is <= 3000; the coupling weight is `1 + 2*shared_asset_count + shared_detector_token_count`, with NO gap-based term (this weight is deliberately different from the directed-reach edge weight). Compute `chain_influence_score` as the fixed point of a SYNCHRONOUS (Jacobi) iteration: initialise every chain's influence to its `chain_risk_score`; in each round compute, for all chains together, `influence_next[c] = chain_risk_score[c] + floor(best_incoming[c] / 2)`, where `best_incoming[c]` is the maximum over c's coupled neighbours n of `influence[n] + weight(c, n)` read from the PREVIOUS round's values, or 0 when c has no coupled neighbour. Every chain in a round is updated from the previous round only; an in-place (Gauss-Seidel) update that reads a neighbour already advanced in the same round is wrong. Iterate until a full round changes no value; `chain_influence_score` is that converged value and `chain_influence_rounds` is the number of rounds that changed at least one value (0 when no chain has a coupled neighbour). ROUNDING: best_incoming // 2 = FLOOR. `chain_influence_digest` = first 12 lowercase SHA256 hex chars of `chain_id|chain_influence_score|chain_influence_rounds`. Reporting: the summary carries `max_chain_influence_score` (max over final signal rows, 0 when none) and `chain_influence_digest_checksum` (SHA256 over the per-row `chain_influence_digest` values joined by a single `|`). Ledger: the per-row `escalation_pressure` gains a floored influence term and is now `escalation_pressure = chain_risk_score + ceil(carry_in / 3) + (chain_reach_score // 6) + (chain_influence_score // 8)`. ROUNDING: chain_influence_score // 8 = FLOOR. Only the carry credit rounds up; the gap decay, chain-size debit, reach term and this influence term are all floored. The influence term affects `escalation_pressure` and the escalation-critical flag only; `carry_out` is unchanged from #KMS-5122 and does NOT include it, so the carry chain still matches #KMS-5396. The escalation-critical threshold stays `escalation_pressure >= 22`.
> **Board decision (2026-06-20 - #KMS-5402)** Halvorsen: two-lag carry propagation (this supersedes the `carry_in` definition in #KMS-5122 and is the latest word on how carry is carried between rows). Post-incident review of burst vault-retrieval storms found that decaying only the immediately preceding row's carry understated pressure when three or more escalated retrievals land in quick succession, because carry shed one row earlier still reflects live retrieval load that has not actually cleared. The carry now blends TWO lags: `carry_in = min(max(previous_carry_out + (carry_out_two_rows_earlier // 3) - (gap_ms // 150), 0), 68)`. The second lag is the `carry_out` of the row two positions earlier in export order (it is 0 for the first two rows of the ledger, so a ledger of fewer than three signal rows is unaffected); it is floored at one third and folded in BEFORE the one-third gap decay is subtracted, and the whole `carry_in` is floored at 0 and capped at the 68 carry ceiling. Everything downstream is unchanged: `escalation_pressure` is still `chain_risk_score + ceil(carry_in / 3) + (chain_reach_score // 6) + (chain_influence_score // 8)` per #KMS-5398; `carry_out` is still `min(carry_in + chain_risk_score - (chain_size // 2), 68)` and now reads this two-lag `carry_in`; the escalation-critical threshold is still `escalation_pressure >= 22`; and #KMS-5123 reporting (ids, count, max, checksum) is unchanged. Only the carry credit rounds up; the two-lag blend, the gap decay and the chain-size debit are floored. ROUNDING: carry_out_two_rows_earlier // 3 = FLOOR.
